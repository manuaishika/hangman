## Technical Approach and Evolution
I started with a frequency analysis technique, calculating letter occurrences across the training dictionary to guide initial guesses. This baseline approach achieved a 45% success rate but faltered against the test set’s variability. To address this, I pivoted to an entropy-based machine learning model, measuring the information gain of each unguessed letter based on pattern-matched candidates. This shift drove success rates to 80–85% in simulations by optimizing guess selection.

Building on this foundation, I developed a hybrid strategy. I introduced an extended initial guess sequence with high-frequency letters to establish early momentum. I then enhanced the entropy model by weighting it with vowel proportion, improving adaptability to word structures, especially for longer words (≥7 letters). When entropy diminished—typically after 6 guesses—I implemented a frequency-based fallback, ensuring resilience. I also pre-organized the dictionary by word length to streamline candidate filtering, boosting computational efficiency.

## Efficiency and Performance
The algorithm’s efficiency stems from its structured dictionary management and adaptive ML-driven guessing. Pre-sorting by length minimized processing overhead, while the entropy-weighted model, refined with vowel insights, maximized predictive power. This combination propelled practice success from 45% to 80–85%, a significant leap over the baseline, showcasing the hybrid technique’s effectiveness.

## Challenges Encountered
The journey was fraught with obstacles. The disjoint test set undermined the initial frequency analysis, making it tough to establish a reliable base—early runs hovered around 45% with rapid try depletion (5–6 guesses). Transitioning to entropy required extensive tuning to align with the test set, and API rate limits and server inconsistencies added further complexity, demanding robust error handling.

## Rationale for the Approach
I began with frequency analysis for its simplicity and dictionary reliance, but its poor test set performance necessitated the entropy model’s adoption. The hybrid approach emerged to merge frequency’s early coverage with entropy’s precision, enhanced by vowel weighting for structural adaptability. This choice balanced feasibility and effectiveness, leveraging dictionary patterns while countering test set unpredictability. The focus on longer words capitalized on the technique’s strength in pattern recognition as letters accumulated.

## Conclusion
This submission reflects my technical evolution, transforming a 45% baseline into an 80–85% practice success rate. The integration of frequency analysis and an entropy-based machine learning model, refined into a hybrid framework, positions it as a strong contender for the 1,000-game recorded evaluation.I have strived to create a unique solution tailored to the challenge. All results have been compiled with the provided key and the challenge’s restrictions in mind, and I’ve done my best to deliver an original and effective solution.
