The solution builds upon a core architecture that interfaces seamlessly with the Hangman API, utilizing a dynamic server selection mechanism to ensure reliable game initiation and response handling. The algorithm employs a multi-layered guessing strategy, combining an enhanced initial guess sequence with an entropy-based prediction model, further augmented by vowel-consonant distribution analysis. This hybrid approach draws inspiration from advanced character-level prediction techniques, such as those seen in transformer-based models like CANINE, adapted to the constraints of the given dictionary and API environment.
