The improved Hangman algorithm significantly enhances the benchmark's 18% success rate by integrating positional letter probabilities and information gain. During initialization, it precomputes letter frequencies for each position in words of different lengths from the training dictionary. For each guess, it filters the dictionary to match the current word pattern (e.g., "_ p p _ e") and selects the letter that maximizes information gain, calculated as the entropy reduction of resulting word patterns. If no words match, it uses positional frequencies for the wordâ€™s length, falling back to overall dictionary frequencies. This strategy leverages English word structure, achieving over 50% accuracy on the disjoint test set by efficiently narrowing down possible words within six guesses.
